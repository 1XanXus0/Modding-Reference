# Mod Template

Tired of softlocking yourself? Great! Put as much information here as you can, explaining what your mod changes/adds, how it works, and what people can expect after installing it.&#x20;

#### How to Install

These are the install steps for mods that are currently available. Change if your mod needs to be installed differently.

* Download the file
* Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MadeInAbyss-BSFD\MadeInAbyss-BSFD\Content\Paks`
* Paste the file
* Make sure the file's name is **MadeInAbyss-BSFD-WindowsNoEditor\_\<Anything>\_P**.pak; with **\<Anything>** being a number, a name or whatever.
* You're done!

#### Download Link

Replace this text with a **direct** download link to your mod. Trustworthy and well-known sources are preferred, such as Mega.

#### Known Bugs

* Put links to incompatible mods here or describe functionality that currently isn't working as expected. Delete if your mod is bug-free.
