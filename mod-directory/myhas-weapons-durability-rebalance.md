# Myha's Weapons Durability Rebalance

Are you frustrated that your new hatchet made of rare abyss material breaks as fast as your pocket knife for scout camp ?
Afraid of using your shiny pickaxe crafted with mystical deep abyss relics because it will fall apart before you reach the 4rth layer ?
Then you're in the right place !

This mod increases the durability of hatchets and pickaxes based on their whistle rank. Weapons have a +15% durability increase for each whistle rank above red :
Red whistle weapons are the base, blue whistle get +15%, moon whistle +30%, black whistle +45% and white whistle +60%.
Relic weapons have twice the bonus of their whistle rank : normal relic get +60%, high relic +90%, special relic +120%.

Ranged weapons are also given a small bonus to keep in line with those changes.


#### Compatibility

This mod is not compatible with mods that change items stat or add items, like Watta's Survival Hatchet or Veta's Items Weight mod.
A patch will need to be made for each of these mods to be compatible with mine.

#### Known Bug

* Weapons you craft or buy will start at the vanilla durability, you will need to go from the abyss to Orth for them to repair to the full modified durability.
