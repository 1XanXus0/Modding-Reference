# \[Cheat] Heatnixx' Thousand Men Wedge V1.0

This mod is more like a Quality of Life mod than a cheat mod. It removes the 'extra hunger drain' flag from the Thousand Men Wedge accessory. While originally a way of balancing the player gaining 300 extra damage, the entire thing can be bypassed anyways by just unequipping the accessory during exploration and re-equipping during combat, so this mod gets rid of the tediousness of it. The mod works even if you already have it equipped, no setup needed.
