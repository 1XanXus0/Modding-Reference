# Beardmo's Skill Rehaul + Watta's Survival Hatchet

_This is a combination mod which allows two mods to be compatible with eachother._\
\
**Beardmo's Skill Rehaul**\
****This mod fixes JAP âžŸ ENG translation errors within the skill tree and provides a general overhaul to the existing skill names as well as their descriptions, to ensure a more fitting setting.\
****\
**Watta's Survival Hatchet**\
Tired of softlocking yourself? Not anymore! The Survival Hatchet is a replacement to the existing Small Hatchet that has (virtually) unlimited durability, but only 10 Attack on its own. Use it to gather resources for a more powerful weapon or, try relying on the base Attack stat you get from leveling up and do some damage with that little razor.
