# Heatnixx' Curse Balancing V1.0

Ever found it annoying how you're a high ranking whistle, yet still somehow end up strained by climbing up the first layer? This mod attempts to rebalance the curse mechanic by changing exactly just that! Now the higher your whistle rank, the less noticeable the curse effects will be on you on the previous layers, enabling you to be as efficient in the early layers as a Black/White whistle should be. On the downside however, the curse will affect lower whistle ranks for longer whenever they're in areas they should not be. Made your way down to the 3rd layer as a red whistle? You're gonna have a hard time coming back up.
