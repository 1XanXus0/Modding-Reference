# Watta's Survival Hatchet

Tired of softlocking yourself? Not anymore! The Survival Hatchet is a replacement to the existing Small Hatchet that has (virtually) unlimited durability, but only 10 Attack on its own. Use it to gather resources for a more powerful weapon or, try relying on the base Attack stat you get from leveling up and do some damage with that little razor.
